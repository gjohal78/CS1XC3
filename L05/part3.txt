(1) Why are all the reported times zero?
    
    Because by default, gprof discards any timing information for functions that 
    take less than 0.01 seconds to execute.

(2) Why is factors_itr only called once every time the program is run?
    
    Factors_itr is called only once for a particular value of d because it is called from 
    within factor_rec, which itself is called only once within the main function. Specifically, 
    factor_rec takes d as its input and within factor_rec, primeFactors_rec is called to
    calculate the prime factors of d, followed by allFactors_rec to generate all potential
    factorizations of d based on its prime factors. Finally, the outcomes are printed via 
    printArray2D. Consequently, since factor_rec is only called once with d as its input, 
    factors_itr is also only called once for that value of d.


(3) Is there an obvious mathematical relationship between the input number 
    and the number of recursive calls? What about the number of prime 
    factors each number produces?
    
    The program will make more recursive calls as the number of prime factors increases. 
    Additionally, larger even numbers will generate more prime factors. However, if a number 
    is a prime, it will not have any prime factors.
