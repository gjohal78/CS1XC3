Describe the differences between Linux and Windows (or MacOS) based on your own experience
with them so far.

Linux is a open-source operating system meaning that it can be used on any device whereas MacOS is a proprietary operating system that 
can only be used in Macs. As well as Linux is generally known to customizable where you can modify the OS whereas for MacOs mainly the kernel 
is open source and and the desktop and applications aren’t. For me I don’t have any experience using linux I have mainly used MacOs or windows and 
what I like about MacOs is how user-friendly and easy it is to use it.
