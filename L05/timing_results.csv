Search Value, Linear Search, Binary Search, Fibonacci Search, Notes
1,0m0.002s,0m0.09s,0m0.001s,"linear search was the fastest here, I believe because it was the first value"
4,0m0.002s,0m0.005s,0m0.003s,"linear search again was the fastest, mabye because it was one of the first values"
22,0m0.007s,0m0.006s,0m0.003s,"fibonacci search was the fastest here, maybe because it's recurisive"
37,0m0.002s,0m0.005s,0m0.002s,fibonacci search and linear search were the same maybe due to it being a number close to beginning and the fibonacci search checking it recursively
22906,0m0.005s,0m0.003s,0m0.003s,"binary and fibonacci search were the same, due to the same time complexity of O(logn)"
53757,0m0.003s,0m0.008s,0m0.002s,"fibonacci search was the fastest again, due to it being recursive"
112591,0m0.005s,0m0.002s,0m0.003s,"binary search was the fastest here, due to its time complexity and not being recursive"
